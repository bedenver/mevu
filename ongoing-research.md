[Parents of children with cerebral palsy and/or vision impairment (0-6 years)](https://rdcap.acu.edu.au/surveys/?s=FCJ8HH3WJ8)

Ongoing data collection within the project includes further evaluation of validity and reliability with the parents of children with cerebral palsy and with the parents of children with vision impairment (ocular and cerebral vision impairment). 

The research team are also exploring the validity of using MEVU with children with vision impairment (ocular and/or cerebral vision impairment). If you are a health or educational professional who works with children with vision impairment we invite you to complete our online survey on MEVU for this population group.
