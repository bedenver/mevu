Ongoing data collection within the project includes further evaluation of validity and reliability with different population groups. The research team are actively looking for clinical and research partners to further this work. If you are interested in collaborating, or if you are a parent/caregiver interested in knowing more about MEVU for your child, please send a message to our team via [this link](https://redcap.acu.edu.au/surveys/?s=FPKTEERANXM4T434).

## Testing MEVU with children with cerebral palsy and/or children with visual impairment

MEVU has already been tested with over 100 children with cerebral palsy and/or visual impairment and it appears to be a good way to describe early visual behaviours in children using observations made by parents/caregivers from everyday activities, interactions, and environments. The focus of the current testing is to know: What does a score on MEVU mean? Is MEVU reliable? The research team need MEVU scores from more parents to test and understand if this measure is helpful.

## Testing MEVU with typically developing children

While MEVU is designed for children with disabilities, right now we're testing MEVU with children who are developing typically. The data we collect now will add to what we've gathered in previous years, giving us a fuller picture. [Click here](https://redcap.acu.edu.au/surveys/?s=R3PLJCA8D48CFEX4)Â to find out more.
