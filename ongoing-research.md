# Research in progress now!

The following research projects are currently open and collecting data with ethics approval from Australian Catholic University HREC 2018-178H. Please click on the link to read further information. 

[Parents of children with cerebral palsy and/or vision impairment (0-6 years)](https://rdcap.acu.edu.au/surveys/?s=FCJ8HH3WJ8)

Ongoing data collection within the project includes further evaluation of validity and reliability with the parents of children with cerebral palsy and with the parents of children with vision impairment (ocular and cerebral vision impairment). We are seeking to answer the following questions:
1) What does a score on MEVU mean?
2) Is MEVU reliable?
3) Is MEVU also use for children with vision impairment? (as it was developed for children with cerebral palsy)

The research team are also exploring the validity of using MEVU with children with vision impairment (ocular and/or cerebral vision impairment) from the perspective of health or educational professionals wworking with children with vision impairment. We also invite you to complete our online survey on MEVU for this population group.
