### I am a parent/caregiver and I would like to complete MEVU for my child. Where can I find it?

Whilst MEVU appears to be valid and useful measurement tool, more testing is currently underway. If you would like to help with this, you can complete MEVU for your child within our research study. See [ongoing research](/ongoing-research/) for more information.

If you are interested in looking at MEVU but do not want to participate in a research study, then that is ok too. We have listed the items on the [home page](/). You can use these questions to think about your child’s visual abilities. You might like to discuss these questions with your child’s clinical team. 

This website will be updated when MEVU is more widely available.

### I completed the online MEVU questionnaire for my child and now believe my child has good vision. Does this mean they don’t have a vision impairment or CVI?

MEVU only describes 'how vision is used' and can be thought of as measuring 'basic visual abilities'. There are many factors that will contribute to a child's visual ability including eye function, brain function, motor ability and the environment. MEVU will complement other assessment results for your child but should not replace examination of your child’s eyes or visual-cognitive abilities.

### I completed the online MEVU questionnaire for my child. How can I get his/her score?
MEVU has so far only been available to parents/caregivers via a research study and scores of individual children have not been analysed. However, if you provided identifying information (e.g. email address) in the research study we can locate your child’s scores and provide these to you. Please email <a href="mailto:belinda.deramoredenver@acu.edu.au">belinda.deramoredenver@acu.edu.au</a> to request this.

A next step in this research study is to develop a way to share scores and to interpret scores. We will update this website as new information and ways to use MEVU become available.

### I am a clinician/researcher. Can I use MEVU?
The results of initial development and validation studies show that MEVU has relevant, comprehensive and comprehensible content for the measurement of visual ability, and that MEVU measures a unidimensional construct, has adequate structural validity, excellent internal consistency, adequate construct validity, and is feasible as a parent-completed online assessment.

Based on these results, MEVU can now be considered by clinicians and researchers for use in practice, however the uptake of MEVU will need to be supported by research on the reliability of MEVU and further data is required to create an interval scoring method that supports meaningful interpretation of scores beyond a simple but quantifiable description. Until this next stage of research is completed MEVU remains available only via a ‘research version’. See [ongoing research](/ongoing-research/) for more information.

### My child has autism. How should I answer the questions?

MEVU is a measure of visual ability.
