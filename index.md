# What is MEVU?

The Measure of Early Vision Use, or MEVU, is a tool that can measure how well your child uses their vision in everyday activities, interactions and environments. 


MEVU describes typical performance in everyday activities, not best performance. 

MEVU is different to a test of the eyes - other factors such as cognition or motor skills might also explain your child's ability to use (or not use) vision in everyday activities. 

To find out how a child uses vision in everyday activities we must ask parents and caregivers who known the child well. MEVU asks questions about visual behaviours that can be observed by people families with your child - you!
